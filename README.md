ONOS : Open Network Operating System
====================================
### Sample Applications
This repository contains sample and testing applications for ONOS.
The original onos-sample-app repository is located in the link below.
https://github.com/opennetworkinglab/onos-app-samples

### Refurbishing ###
I poke the original onos-sample app repository to make it work with ONOS version >= 2.6.0. 
Also, I'd like to make simple working manuals for each sample to help understanding. 

### What is ONOS?
ONOS is a new SDN network operating system designed for high availability,
performance, scale-out.

You can find the main project repository here:
